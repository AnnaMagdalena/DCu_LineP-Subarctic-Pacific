# DCu_LineP-Subarctic-Pacific

_Note this repo is work in porgress_

This repository is to contain all of the scripts and datasets used in a study of dissolved Cu biogeochemistry along Line P in the subarctic NE Pacific. Many of those codes are not annottated well at the moment, but will be updated with descriptions soon. 

Visualization for this project was done mostly in MATLAB, with some scripts in R. This is a list of scripts so far:

* [Produce a map of Gulf of Alaska with line P stations](https://github.com/AnnaMagdalena/DCu_LineP-Subarctic-Pacific/blob/master/Fig1_LineP-map/LineP_map_script_matlab)

* [Contour plot of DCu in top 600m along the transect with overlaid phosphorous contours](https://github.com/AnnaMagdalena/DCu_LineP-Subarctic-Pacific/blob/master/Fig10_Countour-plot-DCu-LineP/Zonal_section-DCu-contour-plot)

* [Plots of Aerosol Optical Thickness from NASA's AquaMODIS (netCDF files)in the Gulf of Alaska](https://github.com/AnnaMagdalena/DCu_LineP-Subarctic-Pacific/blob/master/Fig12_Aerosols-Gulf-of-Alaska/NetCDF_NASA-Aerosols-matlab-script)

* [Subplots of DCu profiles from published studies across the North Pacific - R script](https://github.com/AnnaMagdalena/DCu_LineP-Subarctic-Pacific/tree/master/Fig5_Cu-studies-in-NPacific-profiles)
